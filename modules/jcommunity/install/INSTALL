Installing the jCommunity Module


Copying files
-------------

Copy the jcommunity module in your application or anywhere. Verify that the module repository where it is installed is declared into modulePath property in the general configuration of your application.


About the jauth module
----------------------

You should nothing about it, you can deactivate it. You don't have to install the sql script provided by this module


General configuration
---------------------

in the defaultconfig.ini.php:
- if you have checkTrustedModules=on, you should add jcommunity module in trustedModules.
- Configure all parameters in the mailer section. jCommunity needs to send mail to users.

if you use significant urls, you have an example of urls setting into the urls_example.xml. Copy its content
into the urls.xml file of your application.

execute the install.mysql.sql script on your database. It creates a `community_users` table. If you have already a table of users, you can add new fields of community_users in your table. You should then override all DAOs of the jcommunity module to change the fieldname and the table.

Activation of the auth coordplugin
----------------------------------

You must activate the auth coordplugin in your configuration. Inside your config.ini.php:

    [coordplugins]
    auth = auth.coord.ini.php

And copy the lib/jelix/plugins/coord/auth/auth.coord.ini.php.dist file into yourapp/var/config/auth.coord.ini.php.

In this ini file, you should at least change the values of this properties : 

    driver = Db
    on_error_action = "jcommunity~login:out"
    bad_ip_action = "jcommunity~login:out"
    persistant_enable=on
    persistant_crypt_key=  "INSERT HERE A SENTENCE"
    [Db]
    dao = "jcommunity~user"


Integration into your application
---------------------------------

You can integrate the "status" zone into your main template (directly into the template or via your main response).
  $response->body->assignZone('STATUS', 'jcommunity~status');

It show links to the login form, the register form if the user isn't authenticated, or to the logout page and account page if he is authenticated.
