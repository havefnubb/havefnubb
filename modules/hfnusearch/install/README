hfnusearch.ini.php will help you to tell to the hfnusearch module, in which table to search and in which column of your table to search

you will need to produce a class that extends search_index and overwrite the function searchEngineRun which actually return nothing
You can have a look at the function searchEngineRun of the class search_index_havefnubb for example.

2) To manage your datas search engine :
From you controller you will use only one Event HfnuSearchEngineAddContent like that :

jEvent::notify('HfnuSearchEngineAddContent',array('id'=>$id_post,'datasource'=>'havefnubb~posts'));

The datasource is the DAO in which you will want to add your datas
the id is the value of PK of your DAO.
