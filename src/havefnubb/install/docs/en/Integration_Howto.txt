HaveFnuBB integration inside a Jelix Application

This page describes, step by step, how to install HaveFnuBB inside an existing Jelix application.

The easiest way is to keep every plugins and modules together in a havefnubb directory.

So :

    * Uncompress the archive havefnubb-x.y.z.tar.gz 

part I : modules and plugins installation

    * in the lib dir of jelix, create a havefnubb one.
    * copy havefnubb-x.y.z/''modules'' in lib/havefnubb
    * copy havefnubb-x.y.z/''plugins'' in lib/havefnubb
    * copy the '''content''' of havefnubb-x.y.z/''module-hooks'' in lib/havefnubb/modules 

part II : themes and "web" files

    * copy the '''content''' of havefnubb-x.y.z/''themes'' in your own www/themes directory if it exists or just copy the havefnubb-x.y.z/themes in your www directory
    * copy the '''content''' of havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/''var/themes'' in your own var/themes directory if it exists or just copy the havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/''var/themes'' in your var directory
    * copy the havefnubb-x.y.z/''hfnu'' directory in your www directory
    * copy the havefnubb-x.y.z/''forums.php'' file in your www directory
    * copy the havefnubb-x.y.z/''install.php'' file in your www directory
    * copy the havefnubb-x.y.z/''admin.php'' file in your www directory

part III : configuration files

    * copy :
    * havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/havefnubb
    * havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/admin
    * havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/install
    * havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/havefnu.search.ini.php
    * havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/wikitoolbar.ini.php in your own var/config
    * if you dont already use autolocale then copy havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/autolocale.ini.php too in your own var/config
    * if you use significant url engine, then you need to add to your urls.xml file the 3 entrypoints : 

<classicentrypoint name="forums" default="true" noentrypoint="false">
...
 </classicentrypoint>

 <classicentrypoint name="install" default="false" noentrypoint="false">
...
 </classicentrypoint>
 <classicentrypoint name="admin" default="false" noentrypoint="false">
...
 </classicentrypoint>

in part I we do

    * copy the '''content''' of havefnubb-x.y.z/''module-hooks'' in lib/havefnubb/modules 

So we now have to change the following line :

 modulesPath="lib:jelix-modules/,app:modules/,app:modules-hook/"

by

 modulesPath="lib:jelix-modules/,app:modules/"

in the files

    * havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/havefnubb/config.ini.php
    * havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/admin/config.ini.php
    * havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/install/config.ini.php 

and last be not least, from the file havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/config/mainconfig.ini.php
copy the line from the paragraph [havefnubb] to the end of the file and paste it
at the end of your own var/config/localconfig.ini.php

part IV : Overloads

    * copy the '''content''' of havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/overloads in your own var/overloads if it exists or just copy the havefnubb-x.y.z/havefnubb/var/overloads in your own var/ directory 

part V : Entrypoints

    * in the file forums.php, install.php and admin.php you should see this line :

require ('havefnubb/application.init.php');

    * you have to replace 'havefnubb' by the name of your own application
