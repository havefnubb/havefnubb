0) Configuration of the web environment : 
- If you can specify the document root, upload the content of the archive and point the root of your application to havefnubb/www
more infos on http://jelix.org/articles/en/manual-1.1/application-configuration

- If you cant specify the document root :
have a look at the chapter "If you can't change the document root" on http://jelix.org/articles/en/manual-1.1/application-configuration

1) rename the file havefnubb/var/config/defaultconfig.ini.php.dist in havefnubb/var/config/defaultconfig.ini.php
2) rename the file havefnubb/var/config/dbprofils.ini.php.dist in havefnubb/var/config/dbprofils.ini.php

3) Rights Accesss :
Don't forget to change/check your rights access on all your folder to 755, and your files in 644,
except for the 4 files located in var/config which have to be in 664 : defaultconfig.ini.php, dbprofils.ini.php, flood.coord.ini.php, timeout.coord.ini.php

do the following to change them :
find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

chmod 664 var/config/defaultconfig.ini.php
chmod 664 var/config/dbprofils.ini.php
chmod 664 var/config/havefnubb/flood.coord.ini.php
chmod 664 var/config/havefnubb/timeout.coord.ini.php
chmod 770 cache/images

additionnaly, you could have to change the rights on the temp directory,
effectively it have to be writable to generate the cache

4) URLs settings with HaveFnuBB : 
the default behavior of havefnubb is to use the URL engine significant with the parm multiview to on et enableParser to on.

if you wish to use the URL engine basic_significant, then :
with multiview set to on the URLs will take the form http://localhost/forums.php/ but this one http://localhost/forums.php will lead to a 404 eror page
with multiview set to off the URLs of the form http://localhost/forums.php/ or http://localhost/forums.php will work without any 404 error

5) go to http://_your_domain.com_/install and follow the steps
